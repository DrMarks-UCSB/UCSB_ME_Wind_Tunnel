Project Title: Wind Tunnel Pitot Probe Automation
Background:
•	Currently, the pitot tube on the wind tunnel is placed in a desired location via manual drive systems. 
  •	Placement of the probe along the x-axis, i.e., parallel to the air flow direction, is accomplished using a belt driven system.
  •	Placement of the probe along the y-axis, i.e., perpendicular to the air flow direction, is accomplished using a gear driven system.
•	Potentiometers are used with both systems to provide positional feedback.
Desired Outcome of Project:
•	Replace both manual systems with motorized systems.
•	The user should have the option manually jog the system or run pre-scripted positioning.
  • Program control:
    File should be ASCII text sent via serial port
      Format "< $A??.??; $A??.??; ... >" 
        '<' File start delimiter.
        '$' Line start delimiter. 
        'A' should be either x or y or d  (case does not matter)
        ??.?? desired move-to position or dwell time (in seconds)
          Example $Y0.05 will move the machine along the y-axis to position 0.05 cm
          Example $X22.5 will move the machine along the x-axis to the postion 22.5 cm
          Example $D2.5 will pause the machine for 2.5 second then run next move
        ';' line end delimiter.
        '>' file end delimiter.
        Multiple lines are ok
        Example <$X0.01;$Y10.0;$D5;$Y10.1;>
          Machine move forward to x = 0.01, then imediately to y = 10.0 cm absolute, pause for 5 seconds, then move one millimeter to 10.1 cm absolute
      MATLAB Code: 
        serialportlist("available") % determine correct comport from printout of port list
        windtunnelPitotProbe = serialport("COMx",BAUD_RATE) % COMx: see above line. BAUD: see below, default 74880
        writeline(windtunnelPitotProbe,"<message>")
        % if data is available on the buffer, it can be read using
        read(windtunnelPitotProbe);
